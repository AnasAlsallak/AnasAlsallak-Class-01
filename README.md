## **What i have learned reading the article**

### **Overview**

*The article "Learn the Fundamentals of a Good Developer Mindset in 15 Minutes" highlights the importance of having a strong and positive mindset as a developer. It lists several key characteristics of a good developer mindset, including a focus on learning, continuous improvement, resilience, and a willingness to take risks and try new things. The article also stresses the importance of collaboration and communication, and offers advice on how to maintain a healthy and productive mindset.*

### **Summary**

some factors that damage the software badly are gradual and affect it on the long-term where the complexity becomes obvious.

Here is some ***Guidlines*** to keep in mind to develop a sustainable software:

**1\. Conceiving The Purpose of Software.**
   - The general purpose of all softwares is to help users.
   - Keep asking your self **"How can i help?"** when ever you need to make decisions about the software.

**2\. The Goals of Software Design.**<br>
   Your design should be:
   - Easy for you.
   - Helpful for others for **a long time**.

**3\. (Mis)understanding.**
   - Fully understand the systems and tools you are working with to avoid misunderstanding-complexity cycle.

**4\. Simplicity.**

>**Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci**

   - Stupid, dumb simple and of course bug resistance is the best!
   - Showing off that you are smart doesn’t help.
    
**5\. Complexity.**
   - Know your software purpose and its definition.
   - Be as simple as possible in every piece of code you write. 
   - Resist unnecessary change to the code refering to the exact purpose of the software until you end up convinced if  not dont implement it. 

**6\. Maintenance.**
   - Thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of developers main responsibilities.

**7\. Consistency.**
   - The code and every change on it should be consistent.

**8\. Prioritizing.**
   - The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

**9\. Solving Problems.**
   - You know you understand the problem when you can explain it in simple terms.
   - Plan how you are going to solve it before you act but don't waste a lot of time.
   - Divide the problem into smaller tasks solve each alone then connect the dots.

**10\. Good enough is fine.** 
- Start small on your code, improve it, then extend.

**11\. Predictions.**
- You can’t predict the future.
- Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
- Being too generic involves a lot of code and complexity that isn’t needed.

**12\. Assumptions.**

>**Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.**
> —  Code Simplicity

**13\. Stop Reinventing.**<br>
simply ...

>**Don’t reinvent the wheel.**

**14\. Resistance.**
- *Refer to point 5-3.*

**15\. Automation.**
- Automate repetitive tasks, don't waste you time.

**16\. Code measurement.**
- The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

**17\. Productivity.**
- Keep your code base as small as possible and still effecient.

**18\. Testing.**
- Adding logging in a very early stage will help you to find the problem easily and save your time.
- When you have a bug, first you should reproduce it. 
- You should be reliable. Meaning that your code is always tested and works.

**19\. (Under)Estimation.**
- Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. 
- Everything takes longer than you think it would.

**20\. Running Away From Rewriting.**
- Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, it  is not the solution in most cases.
- It’s harder to read code than to write it this is frequently the problem.
- Refactoring should be the first option.

**21\. Documentation and Commenting.**
- Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT” like explaining why this part can't be less complex. 
- It is important to have documentation:<br>
      ***a.*** To see the high-level picture of your software.<br>
      ***b.*** When a new developer joins your team, it will be easier for them to understand the software as a whole.

**22\. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.).**
- First things first.
- Don't dependent so much on external technologies, it raises alot of problems and complexity.
- Pick technologies that are actively developed, long term maintained, easy to switch from, positively reviwed by the community.

**23\. Self-Development.**
- Keep learning. Try out different languages and tools, read books. They will give you another perspective.
- Big improvements starts small.
- Be open-minded like on which technology to use for you problem.

**24\. Don’t be a hero.**
- Don’t be obsessive. 
- Know when to quit. 
- Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

**25\. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help.**
- Try anything and everything you can think of to solve the problem don't ask for help right away.
- When you can’t think of anything on your own, search and try and understand why?
- Always seek advice. Look to peers and senior developers to review your code.
